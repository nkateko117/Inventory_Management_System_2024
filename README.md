# Inventory_Management_System_2024
This is an inventory management system created by myself. The system uses .Net Core 8 web API backend and Angular 16-17 frontend. The backend uses an SQL database and Entity Framework for data migration and data queries. Open Package Manager Console and run 'update-database' to migrate the database into your local SQL server.
